# Worker Actor Contracts

Botster's workerized runtime boundary starts with typed Rust contracts. This
document describes those contracts without claiming production traffic has moved
onto them yet.

## Ownership

The hub remains the orchestration owner. Workers may request attach, detach,
reconnect, shutdown, lifecycle, and backpressure handling through
`worker::hub_control::HubControlMessage`, but they do not mutate hub state
directly.

Client workers are transport-neutral. They own a per-client stream of session
subscriptions and outbound terminal/control messages using
`worker::client::ClientWorkerMessage`. They identify clients with the existing
`ClientId` type so browser, TUI, socket, and internal clients stay equal.

Transport adapters are the only transport-specific boundary. A WebRTC adapter,
TUI adapter, socket adapter, or future adapter converts its local framing into
`TransportIngress` and converts generic worker output into `TransportEgress`.
Session I/O code and session processes must not import browser or WebRTC
concepts.

Session I/O workers mirror the current per-session process protocol. They carry
PTY input, resize, snapshot, mode flags, plain screen, color profile, structured
terminal events, and process-exit messages as Rust actor messages. The Unix
socket wire protocol in `cli/src/session/protocol.rs` remains the durable
process boundary.

## Data Flow

```text
transport-specific client
  -> TransportAdapter
  -> ClientWorkerMessage
  -> HubControlMessage or SessionIoRequest
  -> Hub-owned state or per-session process
```

Responses flow back through the same layers in reverse. The adapter owns
encoding and delivery details; the client worker owns client-scoped stream
state; the session I/O worker owns session-scoped PTY interaction; the hub owns
orchestration state and lifecycle policy.

## Bounded Queues

Each worker contract exposes a `BoundedQueueConfig` constant:

- `HUB_CONTROL_QUEUE`
- `CLIENT_WORKER_QUEUE`
- `TRANSPORT_ADAPTER_QUEUE`
- `SESSION_IO_WORKER_QUEUE`

Follow-up implementation should use bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels for
these mailboxes. Backpressure is a typed event, not an implicit shared flag.
This matches the existing hot-path observability work in
`docs/hub-hot-path-observability.md`, where queue pressure is logged locally and
handled by the hub event loop.

Backpressure is intentionally represented at two scopes. Hub-control
backpressure carries routing context, including the source, capacity,
`session_uuid`, and `client_id`, because the hub needs enough information to
decide policy and mutate orchestration state. Client-worker backpressure keeps
only the local source and capacity, because that mailbox is already scoped to a
single client and should not grow a parallel routing identity.

## Session Process Boundary

The session process remains minimal and per-session. It owns the PTY fd,
terminal parsing, snapshots, mode tracking, and process lifecycle. It does not
route clients, inspect browser state, or know about WebRTC. Worker contracts
must preserve that boundary: browser/TUI/socket concerns stop at the transport
adapter and client worker.
