# Cargo configuration for botster-hub
#
# Ensures tests always run in test mode (BOTSTER_ENV=test)
# which enables test-specific behavior like:
# - Skipping authentication
# - Using tmp/botster-test for data directories
# - Reduced heartbeat intervals

[env]
# Set BOTSTER_ENV=test for all test runs
# Simple format is more reliable across cargo versions
BOTSTER_ENV = "test"
