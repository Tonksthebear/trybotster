//! Hub - Botster control-plane orchestrator.
//!
//! The Hub coordinates Botster lifecycle and policy: session creation,
//! attach/detach decisions, plugin routing, server registration, pairing, and
//! recovery. Hot terminal bytes, initial scrollback, and per-client stream
//! state belong to Session I/O and ClientWorker actors rather than the hub
//! event loop.
//!
//! # Architecture

//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - `server_comms`: WebSocket command channel, notification worker, registration
//! - `actions`: Hub action dispatch
//! - Agent lifecycle is fully Lua-owned (`handlers/agents.lua` + `lib/agent.lua`)
//! - `registration`: Device and hub registration
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let hub = Hub::new(config)?;
//! hub.run()?;  // Starts event loop with TUI
//! // or
//! hub.run_headless()?;  // Starts event loop without TUI
